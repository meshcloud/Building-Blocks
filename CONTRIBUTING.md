## Contributing Pull Requests

For changes on code a new branch must be created from main. E.g. you create a new great feature that is ready for review. You create a branch feature/something-really-great and submit it as a PR against main.

After approval âœ… your code is merged automatically by our mergebot as soon as you apply the automerge label to your PR.
